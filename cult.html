            <h3>The Origins of Golf</h3>
            <p>Golf has its roots in Scotland, where it began to be played in a rudimentary form in the 15th century. Although the modern game includes elements from other ancient sports, it was in Scotland that it was formalized, with clear rules and the creation of the first golf courses. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the sport gained popularity in Europe and later in the United States. Today, golf is one of the most practiced sports worldwide, known for its precision and strategic focus.</p>

            <h3>Evolution of Golf Equipment</h3>
            <p>Golf equipment has evolved significantly since its early days. In the beginning, clubs were made of wood and balls were leather filled with feathers. Over the years, technological advances have led to clubs made of steel, titanium, and other lightweight and durable materials. Balls have also improved, with new layers and designs that allow better control and greater distance. These developments have made golf more accessible and precise, enhancing the experience for both beginners and professionals.</p>
